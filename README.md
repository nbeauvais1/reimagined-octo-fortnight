# Plant Store Dashboard

### In this project I create the start of a react app that will be a dashboard for a plant store. The project was created using styled components.

## March 25 Update

### Continuing on with the project, I add functionality to the login page and secured the dashboard so only users could view it. The 404 page has been updated to show a custom page and product cards have been created. The next goal is the create forms to be able to created update and delete products!
